# GeX (Gene Expression Explorer)

## 🧬 Description
**GeX** is a bioinformatics web application for gene expression analysis and visualization. It allows users to input gene sequences and visualize expression differences between healthy and diseased samples using an interactive dashboard.

A lightweight AI model is integrated to predict whether the input gene sequence is diseased or not.

---

## 🧪 Problem Statement

- Public genomics datasets are difficult to interpret for non-experts.
- There’s a lack of simple tools to compare gene expression between healthy and diseased samples.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

- A user-friendly web tool that allows easy search, analysis, and visualization of differentially expressed genes from **GEO datasets**.
- Built for non-bioinformatics users with an intuitive interface and real-time visual feedback.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS,JS
- **Backend**: Python (Fastapi)
- **Libraries**: GEOparse, Pandas, SciPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Chart.js
- **Data Source**: NCBI GEO

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Gene Query & Search**: View gene expression across healthy and diseased samples.
2. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identify up/downregulated genes using fold change and p-value.
3. **Interactive Charts**: Visualize data using box plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots.
4. **Expression Filters**: Filter results by expression threshold.
5. **AI-Based Prediction**: Predict whether an input gene is healthy or diseased.
6. **Export Results** *(Planned)*: CSV/PDF download support.
7. **Multiple Dataset Comparison** *(Planned)*: Upload and compare more than one dataset.
8. **Gene Metadata Integration** *(Planned)*: Link genes with databases like Ensembl or UniProt.
